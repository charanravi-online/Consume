For \( \text{data} = \text{np.random.rand}(2^{48}) \), the code generates an array with \(2^{48}\) random numbers between 0 and 1 using NumPy. The memory consumption can be calculated based on the size of each element in the array.

Assuming the default data type is 64-bit floating-point numbers (8 bytes per element in NumPy), the total memory consumption would be:

\[ 2^{48} \, \text{elements} \times 8 \, \text{bytes/element} = 2^{51} \, \text{bytes} \]

This corresponds to \(2^{41}\) gigabytes, or approximately 2 terabytes. It's important to note that creating such a large array may exceed the available RAM on many systems, leading to potential memory errors or performance issues. Always consider the available resources on your machine before running code that allocates a significant amount of memory.
